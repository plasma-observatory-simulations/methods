Vlasiator
^^^^^^^^^

Vlasiator is a 6D ion-kinetic hybrid-Vlasov model for the Earth's global magnetosphere. Vlasiator simulates the dynamics of plasma using a hybrid-Vlasov model, where protons are described by their distribution function f(r,v,t) in ordinary (r) and velocity (v) space, and electrons are a charge-neutralising fluid. This approach neglects electron kinetic effects but retains ion kinetics. The time-evolution of f(r,v,t) is given by Vlasov's equation, which is coupled self-consistently to Maxwell's equations giving the evolution of the electric and magnetic fields E and B. Maxwell's equations neglect the displacement current. The equations are closed by a generalised Ohm's law including the Hall term.

HYPSI
^^^^^

HYPSI is an hybrid-kinetic PIC code, where ions are modelled as macroparticles and advanced using the standard PIC method while the electrons are modelled as a massless, charge-neutralizing fluid with an adiabatic equation of state. 

HYPSI supports several initialisations and boundary conditions, the most used one of which allows the propagation of a shock wave in the simulation domain. This is done thorugh the injection method, employing an open inlow boundary and a reflective wall. The other two directions have periodic boundary conditions. Importantly, HYPSI was one of the first codes supporting a realistic turbulent initialisation for the shock upstream. Such turbulent initialisation is performed through a combination of MHD and hybrid kinetic simulations, where the output of an MHD model becomes the initial condition for the shock simulation. An important aspect of this initialisation is that the perturbation is finite in both space and time extent. Recent improvements allow for continuous injection of upstream turbulence.  

Two-dimensional datasets covering a large shock parameter range (0 to 90 degrees shock normal angles, 0.1 to 10 plasma beta, Alfvanic Mach numbers 2 to 30) are easily provided upon request, useful to look at electromagnetic fields, plasma moments, particle distributions. Turbulent and three-dimensional runs can also be provided, though they require more planning due to computational constraint. An extensive set of software to analyse HYPSI output is also available upon request in both MATLAB and Python, with the Python version 'hypy' being released soon.

SWMF
^^^^

The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) is a software framework which models a wide range of temporal and spatial scales as well as the different physical processes governing the different heliophysics domains through a modular approach. The heart of the framework is the BATS-R-US versatile, high-performance, generalized magnetohydrodynamic code with adaptive mesh refinement that can be configured to solve the governing equations of ideal and resistive MHD, semi-relativistic, anisotropic, Hall, multispecies, and multi-fluid extended magnetofluid equations (XMHD) and non-neutral multifluid plasmas. The BATS-R-US is used to model several physics domains, and its high efficiency (faster than real time) is crucial for the success of the framework. Further descriptions of the SWMF modules can be found below.

*muphyII* 
^^^^^^^^^^

The *muphyII* code is a simulation framework for collisionless plasma physics and targeted at space plasmas in particular. The *muphyII* code utilizes a hierarchy of models with different inherent scales to address the separation of scales problem typically encountered in these plasmas. It allows stand-alone use of models as well as a model-based dynamic and adaptive domain decomposition and resorts to novel techniques for energy conservation, careful treatment of inner-domain model boundaries for interface coupling, and robust time stepping algorithms.

PIRAN: Particles In ResonANce
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quasilinear diffusion coefficients can be used to characterise the statistical response of charged particles to perturbations by plasma waves, via resonant wave-particle interactions. The open-source PIRAN software package ("Particles In ResonANce") is written using Python, and allows the user to calculate relativistic diffusion coefficients in kinetic energy and pitch-angle space via the two main current proposed methods in the literature.
